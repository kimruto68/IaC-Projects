# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Projects with Terraform

After completing a comprehensive Terraform course on Udemy, I was inspired to start applying my skills through hands-on projects. To ensure proper version control and to build a public portfolio, I decided to connect my local Terraform projects to GitHub.

This repository will host various Terraform projects as I progress in my Infrastructure as Code journey. Each project will be organized in its own subdirectory and include relevant Terraform configuration files, documentation, and examples.

Feel free to explore, clone, or contribute!
